# React challenge

## What The Test App Should Do

- allow the user to select a product and quantity and add it to the products table
- the table should display a subtotal for each order line
- if the user enters the code PROMO10, a promotional discount of 10% should be applied to product subtotals
- quantity could be modified also in the table
- remove column should implement a button to remove the item from the list
- use styled component and your creativity to create a nice looking app
- it's a plus if you use TS and if you type existing variables typed as `any`
